                <p>
                Bridgevolt Cooperative is a non-profit worker-owned organization based in Bridgeport, CT. Our mission is to provide transportation options that are affordable, convenient, and environmentally sustainable.</p>

                <p>
                We are proud to present our e-bike conversion kit. This kit allows for easy conversion of nearly any bicycle into an e-bike, which allows riders to repurpose the bikes they already own and love and use them as a practical everyday vehicle.</p>
